# sbt-scalabuff

[SBT](http://github.com/harrah/xsbt) plugin to generate scala case class from [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) using [ScalaBuff](https://github.com/SandroGrzicic/ScalaBuff).

## Usage

Adding the plugin:

    addSbtPlugin("com.github.sbt" %% "sbt-scalabuff" % "0.2")

Enable the plugin in your build:

    import scalabuff.ScalaBuffPlugin._

    object build extends Build {
      lazy val root = Project("main", file("."), settings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ scalabuffSettings).configs(ScalaBuff)
    }

Once activated place your '.proto' definition in *src/main/protobuf* and that's all!
